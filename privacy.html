                        •	Contact Information: such as your name, email address and telephone number for marketing purposes is retained on an ongoing basis until you unsubscribe. Thereafter we will add your details to our suppression list to ensure we do not inadvertently market to you.<br>
                        •	Content: that you post on our website such as support desk comments, photographs, videos, blog posts, and other content may be kept after you close your account for audit, abuse prevention and crime prevention purposes (e.g. for seven years to prevent a known fraudulent actor from opening a new account).<br>
                        •	Information collected via technical means such as cookies and other similar tools is kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie.</p>
                      <p>We protect your personal information by maintaining physical, technical, and organizational measures, such as firewalls and data encryption, and physical and technical access controls. However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. Please recognize that you also play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering with Cast.Art, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.</p>
                      <p>Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, please contact us using the contact information provided in the “How to contact us” section below.</p>
                      <p>8. CHILDREN<br>
                        The Cast.Art Service is not intended for use by anyone under 18 years of age. If you are under 18 years of age, please do not provide any personal information through the Cast.Art Service. If you are a parent or guardian of a child from whom you believe we have collected personal information in a manner prohibited by law, please contact us using the contact information provided in the “How to contact us” section below. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the Cast.Art Service from a child without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will comply with applicable legal requirements to delete the information.  If there is any personal information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent our further processing or use of this personal information.</p>
                      <p>9. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY<br>
                        We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on Cast.Art or other appropriate means. Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the modified version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your use of Cast.Art after the effective date of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
                      <p>10. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS<br>
                        To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer, store, and process your personal information within our affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers based throughout the world, including Ireland, Germany, Singapore, Japan, the UK, the US, the Philippines, and possibly other countries. We will protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed and will take appropriate contractual or other steps to protect the relevant personal information in accordance with applicable laws. We contractually obligate recipients of your personal information to agree to at least the same level of privacy safeguards as required under applicable data protection laws. </p>
                      <p>We rely primarily on Standard Contractual Clauses (as approved by relevant national data protection regulators) to facilitate the international and onward transfer of personal information from one country to another, to the extent the recipient country is considered to not provide an adequate level of data protection. This includes transfers of non-US customer data to our US-based operating entity, NFT Technologies. We may also rely on judicial adequacy decisions confirming an adequate level of data protection in the jurisdiction of the party receiving the information, or derogations in specific situations.<br>
                        By communicating electronically with NFT Technologies, you acknowledge and agree to your personal information being processed in this way. If you have a complaint about our privacy practices and our collection, use or disclosure of personal information please submit your request via our Support Portal.</p>
                      <p>11. YOUR CHOICES<br>
                        Access or update your information: If you have registered for an account with us through the Cast.Art Service, you may review and update certain account information by logging into the account. </p>
                      <p>Opt-out of marketing communications: You may opt-out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email, or by contacting us. Please note that if you choose to opt-out of marketing-related emails, you may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.  </p>
                      <p>Depending on applicable law where you reside, you may also be able to assert certain rights related to your personal information identified below. Your access to these rights may be limited or denied: (a) when denial of access is required or authorized by law; (b) when granting access would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others; (c) to protect our rights and properties; (d) where the request is frivolous or vexatious, or for other reasons.</p>
                      <p>Access and data portability: You may request that we provide you a copy of personal information held by us. This information will be provided without undue delay subject to a potential fee associated with gathering of the information (as permitted by law). In certain circumstances, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transmit your personal information to another data controller.</p>
                      <p>Correction of incomplete or inaccurate personal information: You may request that we correct any of your personal information held by NFT Technologies that is incomplete or inaccurate, by logging in to your account and clicking the Profile or My Account tab.</p>
                      <p>Erasure: You may request to erase your personal information, subject to applicable law. </p>
                      <p>Withdraw consent: To the extent the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. This withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of NFT Technologies’ processing based on consent before your withdrawal.</p>
                      <p>Restriction of processing: In some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to restrict or object to us processing or transferring your personal information under certain circumstances. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.</p>
                      <p>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling: NFT Technologies relies on automated tools to, for example, help determine whether a transaction or a customer account presents a fraud or legal risk. In some jurisdictions, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you, or similarly significantly affects you, save for the exceptions applicable under relevant data protection laws.<br>
                        •	Marketing communications: You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from NFT Technologies. Direct marketing includes any communications to advertise or promote our products and services. We will only contact you by electronic means based on our legitimate interests, as permitted by applicable law, or your consent. If you do not want us to send you marketing communications, please go to your account settings to opt-out or submit a request via our Support Portal. <br>
                        •	To the extent we can rely on legitimate interest under the applicable law, we will only send you information about Cast.Art that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you. We will contact you by electronic means for marketing purposes only if you have consented to such communication. You may raise such objections with regard to initial or further processing for purposes of direct marketing, at any time and free of charge.</p>
                      <p>Declining to provide information. We need to collect personal information such as your name, and a crypto wallet to provide certain services. If you do not provide the information we designate as required or mandatory, we may not be able to provide those services.</p>
                      <p>Linked third-party platforms. If you choose to connect to Cast.Art through your social media account or other third-party platform, you may be able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the information we receive from it. If you revoke our ability to access information from a third-party platform, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.</p>
